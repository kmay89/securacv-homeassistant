"""Pure helpers for SD-card / storage health metrics.

The kernel's token-gated `GET /status` endpoint and the Canary firmware's
MQTT `health` payload both carry storage endurance metrics (free space,
estimated wear against the card's TBW rating, write errors, thermal state).
These helpers normalize those payloads for the sensor/binary_sensor
platforms.

Deliberately free of any `homeassistant.*` imports so they run under the
stub-based test harness in tests/conftest.py.
