"""Assist intents — read-only voice answers about the fleet.

Home Assistant's ``intent`` component discovers this platform and calls
``async_setup_intents``. The handlers registered here answer the local
voice pipeline (docs/voice_control.md), and are grouped by how people
actually ask:

  - the catch-up:   SecuracvWhatsUp        "what's up", "what did I miss"
  - the crisp ones: SecuracvFleetStatus    "is the fleet OK?"
                    SecuracvLastEvent      "what was the last event?"
                    SecuracvOfflineCheck   "is anything offline?"
                    SecuracvRoster         "what Canaries do I have?"
                    SecuracvDeviceCheck    "how's the gate Canary?"
  - the rituals:    SecuracvGoodnight      "goodnight"
  - about itself:   SecuracvPrivacy        "are you listening to me?"
                    SecuracvHelp           "what can I ask you?"

All are queries. There are deliberately no action intents: voice may ask
about the fleet but cannot arm, disarm, mute, or otherwise change the
security posture — a spoken word carries no signature, so those paths stay
on authenticated surfaces (AGENTS.md rule 1; the voice contract in
docs/research/whisper_local_voice.md §3.1). The sentences that trigger
these intents ship in docs/voice_sentences_en.yaml for the user to copy
into ``config/custom_sentences/en/``.

The answer-building logic lives in ``voice.py`` (pure, host-tested); this
file only snapshots hass.data and hands plain dicts over.
