"""The canary base's SD story reaches Home Assistant (backlog F25).

HA's SD Removed sensor reads ``sd_mounted`` from the health payload
(binary_sensor.py's per-type tamper sensor). The canary PIO tree's MQTT
health publish never carried that key — only ``sd_healthy`` / ``sd_errors``
— so the sensor could not fire for a canary base whatever happened to its
card. The firmware now sends ``sd_mounted`` once a card has mounted this
boot (a card-less boot is a configuration, not a removal, and an absent key
reads as mounted here).

These tests pin the field name and the shapes the canary publishes: a
pulled card, the card back, a failing card still in the slot (ERROR, which
is SD Error's story and must not light SD Removed), and a card-less boot.
In the monorepo, where the firmware source sits next to the integration,
they also prove the canary's health publisher still spells the key; the
HACS mirror carries no firmware, so that one test skips there.
