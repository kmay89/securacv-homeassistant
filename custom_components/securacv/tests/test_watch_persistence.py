"""Watches survive a Home Assistant restart (watch_runtime persistence).

Before this, the bucket lived only in ``hass.data`` and every reboot of the
hub silently ended every watch — "I'll tell you if anything changes" became
a promise that lasted until the next update. Now ``watch_runtime`` mirrors
the bucket to HA's ``Store`` with coalesced saves and restores it during
``async_setup_entry``, before anything can feed it.

The restart is simulated the way test_replay_persistence.py does it: a
Store stub whose payloads outlive the instance that wrote them, keyed as
HA's real one is, and a fresh ``HomeAssistant`` booted through the
integration's real setup.
