"""Fleet voice briefs — the pure logic behind the Assist intents.

This module is the host-testable half of the hub's local voice support
(``intent.py`` is the thin Home Assistant-facing half). It turns the
integration's runtime state — the per-entry ``devices`` and ``verify``
dicts plus the kernel coordinator's latest data — into short, honest
spoken answers for the read-only intents:

  - "is the fleet OK?"        -> speak_fleet_status()
  - "what was the last event" -> speak_last_event()
  - "what's up?"              -> speak_whats_up()
  - "how's the gate Canary?"  -> speak_device_check()
  - "is anything offline?"    -> speak_offline_check()
  - "what Canaries do I have" -> speak_roster()
  - "goodnight"               -> speak_goodnight()
  - "are you listening?"      -> speak_privacy()
  - "what can I ask you?"     -> speak_help()

Vocabulary discipline (docs/GLOSSARY.md) is load-bearing here, because a
spoken sentence is quoted out of context by design:

  - "verified" is said ONLY when an Ed25519 signature checked against a
    pinned key (the verify dict's ``trusted`` flag, stamped by
    ``async_record_verify``). Everything looser is "heard" or "publishing
    unsigned".
  - Time is spoken coarsely (ten-minute floor), matching the project's
    stance that precision is a privacy cost. The times here are hub
    arrival times, not the sealed coarse buckets, so "about" phrasing is
    also simply honest.

There are deliberately no action intents and no identity answers — voice
may query, never change the security posture (AGENTS.md rule 1, and the
voice contract in docs/research/whisper_local_voice.md §3.1).

No Home Assistant imports here: pure functions over plain dicts, tested
by ``tests/test_voice.py`` under the same stub harness as the rest of the
component's logic.

       wake word may be any phrase the owner trained, so a flat "I listen

       this project recommends. Both modes are described conditionally,

    2. It admits the wake-word residue (docs/voice_control.md, "What
       turning a wake word on means") rather than claiming a purity the
       design doesn't have.

    Composed from the contract, never from runtime state, so no setting
