"""Watch runtime — the live half of watches.

``watches.py`` is the pure engine; this is the thin Home Assistant layer
that actually feeds it and speaks for it. It exists so a started watch is
genuinely watching: without it the spoken promise ("I'll tell you if
anything changes") would be a claim the system cannot keep, which is the
one thing this project treats as worse than a missing feature.

Two lanes:

  - ``async_observe_event`` — called from the MQTT event path, records one
    observation against every watch bound to that device.
  - ``async_tick`` — called on a timer, evaluates every watch, delivers
    anything that fired, and announces expiry (silence is never rendered
    as safety, so a watch that ends says so).

Delivery is a ``persistent_notification``, the same lane the integration
already uses for a key mismatch: local, no cloud, no new dependency.

Starting, listing and ending go through here too (``async_start_watch``,
``async_watch_bucket``, ``async_end_watch``): the voice intents and the
``securacv.*`` actions share one path, so a watch is the same object
however it began and every change is persisted the same way.

Persistence: the bucket lives in ``hass.data[DOMAIN]["watches"]``. It is
mirrored to HA's ``Store`` (``.storage/securacv_watches``) by one queued
write at a time, which lands within ``SAVE_DELAY_SECONDS`` of the first
change and is never pushed back. ``async_load_watches`` restores it once
per HA instance during setup. So a watch survives a clean restart (HA
flushes a queued write on the way down), and a crash or power cut loses
at most the last few seconds of changes. A watch that ended while the hub
was down is restored too, and the first tick announces it rather than
letting it vanish.
